# Pong
My version of the classic arcade game [pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) (work-in-progress, made from scratch)
Will be expanded to allow an AI to learn the game using machine learning as you watch, similar to my [flappy bird AI](https://alecthekulak.github.io/flappy) web app (which used reinforcement learning to become better at "[flappy bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird)" a popular mobile game).
